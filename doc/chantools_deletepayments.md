## chantools deletepayments

Remove all (failed) payments from a channel DB

This command removes all payments from a channel DB.
If only the failed payments should be deleted (and not the successful ones), the
--failedonly flag can be specified.

CAUTION: Running this command will make it impossible to use the channel DB
with an older version of lnd. Downgrading is not possible and you'll need to
run lnd v0.17.0-beta or later after using this command!'
