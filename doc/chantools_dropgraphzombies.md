## chantools dropgraphzombies

Remove all channels identified as zombies from the graph to force a re-sync of the graph

### Synopsis

This command removes all channels that were identified as
zombies from the local graph.

This will cause lnd to re-download all those channels from the network and can
be helpful to fix a graph that is out of sync with the network.

CAUTION: Running this command will make it impossible to use the channel DB
with an older version of lnd. Downgrading is not possible and you'll need to
run lnd v0.17.0-beta or later after using this command!'
